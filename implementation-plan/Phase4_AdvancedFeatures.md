# Phase 4: Tuning and Advanced Features (Optional)

- [X] **Tuning Parameters**:
    - [X] Experiment with `perceptionRadius`, `desiredSeparation`, `maxSpeed`, `maxForce` (indirectly via sliders affecting behavior).
    - [X] Adjust weights for separation, alignment, and cohesion forces to achieve different flocking behaviors (sliders implemented).
- [X] **Obstacle Avoidance**:
    - [X] Define obstacle shapes (Rectangles used as per brief, coordinates corrected).
    - [X] Implement logic for boids to detect and steer away from obstacles (proactive steering force and robust bounce/wrap logic).
- [ ] **Mouse Interaction**:
    - [ ] Add mouse listeners to the `Canvas`.
    - [ ] Implement behaviors like:
        - [ ] Attracting boids towards the mouse cursor.
        - [ ] Repelling boids from the mouse cursor.
        - [ ] Adding new boids on mouse click.
- [ ] **Goal Seeking / Path Following**:
    - [ ] Define target points or paths for boids to follow.
- [X] **User Interface (GUI Controls)**:
    - [X] Add Swing components (sliders, JSpinner) to the `JFrame` to allow real-time adjustment of simulation parameters (number of boids, `maxSpeed`, rule weights).
- [ ] **Performance Optimization** (if dealing with many boids):
    - [ ] Consider spatial partitioning techniques (e.g., grid or quadtree) for more efficient neighborhood searches if performance becomes an issue with a large number of boids (e.g., 500+). (Currently using `CopyOnWriteArrayList` for thread-safe boid list modifications, neighborhood search is O(N) per boid).
- [ ] **Additional Brief-Mentioned Features for High Marks**:
    - [ ] Control over simulation speed (e.g., via a GUI slider affecting `SIMULATION_DELAY_MS`).
    - [ ] Other types of individuals for the flock to interact with (e.g., predators, diseased individuals - would involve more significant OO design with inheritance/polymorphism).
